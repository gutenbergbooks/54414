/>N the Old Colony days, in Plymouth the land of the Pilgrims,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To and fro in a room of his simple and primitive dwelling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clad in doublet and hose, and boots of Cordovan leather,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_004" id="page_004"></a>{4}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strode, with a martial air, Miles Standish the Puritan Captain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Buried in thought he seemed, with his hands behind him, and pausing<span class="linenum">5</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ever and anon to behold his glittering weapons of warfare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hanging in shining array along the walls of the chamber,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cutlass and corslet of steel, and his trusty sword of Damascus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Curved at the point and inscribed with its mystical Arabic sentence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While underneath, in a corner, were fowling-piece, musket, and matchlock.<span class="linenum">10</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Short of stature he was, but strongly built and athletic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_005" id="page_005"></a>{5}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Broad in the shoulders, deep-chested, with muscles and sinews of iron;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brown as a nut was his face, but his russet beard was already<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flaked with patches of snow, as hedges sometimes in November.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Near him was seated John Alden, his friend, and household companion,<span class="linenum">15</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Writing with diligent speed at a table of pine by the window;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair-haired, azure-eyed, with delicate Saxon complexion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Having the dew of his youth, and the beauty thereof, as the captives<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom Saint Gregory saw, and exclaimed, “Not Angles but Angels.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_006" id="page_006"></a>{6}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Youngest of all was he of the men who came in the May Flower.<span class="linenum">20</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Suddenly breaking the silence, the diligent scribe interrupting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spake, in the pride of his heart, Miles Standish the Captain of Plymouth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Look at these arms,” he said, “the warlike weapons that hang here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burnished and bright and clean, as if for parade or inspection!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is the sword of Damascus I fought with in Flanders; this breastplate,<span class="linenum">25</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well I remember the day! once saved my life in a skirmish;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here in front you can see the very dint of the bullet<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_007" id="page_007"></a>{7}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fired point-blank at my heart by a Spanish arcabucero.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had it not been of sheer steel, the forgotten bones of Miles Standish<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would at this moment be mould, in their grave in the Flemish morasses.”<span class="linenum">30</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thereupon answered John Alden, but looked not up from his writing:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Truly the breath of the Lord hath slackened the speed of the bullet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He in his mercy preserved you, to be our shield and our weapon!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still the Captain continued, unheeding the words of the stripling:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“See, how bright they are burnished, as if in an arsenal hanging;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_008" id="page_008"></a>{8}</span><span class="linenum">35</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That is because I have done it myself, and not left it to others.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Serve yourself, would you be well served, is an excellent adage;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I take care of my arms, as you of your pens and your inkhorn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, too, there are my soldiers, my great, invincible army,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twelve men, all equipped, having each his rest and his matchlock,<span class="linenum">40</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eighteen shillings a month, together with diet and pillage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, like Cæsar, I know the name of each of my soldiers!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This he said with a smile, that danced in his eyes, as the sunbeams<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_009" id="page_009"></a>{9}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dance on the waves of the sea, and vanish again in a moment.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alden laughed as he wrote, and still the Captain continued:<span class="linenum">45</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Look! you can see from this window my brazen howitzer planted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High on the roof of the church, a preacher who speaks to the purpose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Steady, straight-forward, and strong, with irresistible logic,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Orthodox, flashing conviction right into the hearts of the heathen.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now we are ready, I think, for any assault of the Indians;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_010" id="page_010"></a>{10}</span><span class="linenum">50</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let them come, if they like, and the sooner they try it the better,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let them come, if they like, be it sagamore, sachem or pow-wow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aspinet, Samoset, Corbitant, Squanto, or Tokamahamon!”<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Long at the window he stood, and wistfully gazed on the landscape,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Washed with a cold gray mist, the vapory breath of the east-wind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_011" id="page_011"></a>{11}</span><span class="linenum">55</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forest and meadow and hill, and the steel-blue rim of the ocean,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lying silent and sad, in the afternoon shadows and sunshine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over his countenance flitted a shadow like those on the landscape,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gloom intermingled with light; and his voice was subdued with emotion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tenderness, pity, regret, as after a pause he proceeded:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Yonder there, on the hill by the sea, lies buried Rose Standish;<span class="linenum">60</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beautiful rose of love, that bloomed for me by the wayside!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She was the first to die of all who came in the May Flower!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_012" id="page_012"></a>{12}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Green above her is growing the field of wheat we have sown there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Better to hide from the Indian scouts the graves of our people,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest they should count them and see how many already have perished!”<span class="linenum">65</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sadly his face he averted, and strode up and down, and was thoughtful.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Reading the marvelous words and achievements of Julius Cæsar.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Mute with amazement and sorrow, Priscilla the Puritan maiden<span class="linenum">105</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looked into Alden’s face, her eyes dilated with wonder,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feeling his words like a blow, that stunned her and rendered her speechless;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till at length she exclaimed, interrupting the ominous silence:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">This is not right nor just: for surely a woman’s affection<span class="linenum">125</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">What were an answer befitting the hostile message and menace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Talking of this and of that, contriving, suggesting, objecting;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One voice only for peace, and that the voice of the Elder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_070" id="page_070"></a>{70}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Judging it wise and well that some at least were converted,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rather than any were slain, for this was but Christian behavior!<span class="linenum">120</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then outspake Miles Standish, the stalwart Captain of Plymouth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Muttering deep in his throat, for his voice was husky with anger,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“What! do you mean to make war with milk and the water of roses?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is it to shoot red squirrels you have your howitzer planted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There on the roof of the church, or is it to shoot red devils?<span class="linenum">125</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Truly the only tongue that is understood by a savage<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_071" id="page_071"></a>{71}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must be the tongue of fire that speaks from the mouth of the cannon!”<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Not from the cannon’s mouth were the tongues of fire they spake with!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But unheeded fell this mild rebuke on the Captain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who had advanced to the table, and thus continued discoursing:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Leave this matter to me, for to me by right it pertaineth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_072" id="page_072"></a>{72}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">War is a terrible trade; but in the cause that is righteous,<span class="linenum">135</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet is the smell of powder; and thus I answer the challenge!”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then from the rattlesnake’s skin, with a sudden, contemptuous gesture,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jerking the Indian arrows, he filled it with powder and bullets<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full to the very jaws, and handed it back to the savage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saying, in thundering tones: “Here, take it! this is your answer!”<span class="linenum">140</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silently out of the room then glided the glistening savage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_073" id="page_073"></a>{73}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bearing the serpent’s skin, and seeming himself like a serpent,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thereupon answered John Alden, the scholar, the friend of Miles Standish:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“I was not angry with you, with myself alone I was angry,<span class="linenum">25</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seeing how badly I managed the matter I had in my keeping.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“No!” interrupted the maiden, with answer prompt and decisive;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“No; you were angry with me, for speaking so frankly and freely.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was wrong, I acknowledge; for it is the fate of a woman<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long to be patient and silent, to wait like a ghost that is speechless,<span class="linenum">30</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till some questioning voice dissolves the spell of its silence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_100" id="page_100"></a>{100}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hence is the inner life of so many suffering women<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Chafing their channels of stone, with endless and profitless murmurs.”<span class="linenum">35</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thereupon answered John Alden, the young man, the lover of women:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Heaven forbid it, Priscilla; and truly they seem to me always<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More like the beautiful rivers that watered the garden of Eden,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More like the river Euphrates, through deserts of Havilah flowing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_101" id="page_101"></a>{101}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Filling the land with delight, and memories sweet of the garden!”<span class="linenum">40</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Ah, by these words, I can see,” again interrupted the maiden,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“How very little you prize me, or care for what I am saying.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When from the depths of my heart, in pain and with secret misgiving,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Frankly I speak to you, asking for sympathy only and kindness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Straightway you take up my words, that are plain and direct and in earnest,<span class="linenum">45</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turn them away from their meaning, and answer with flattering phrases.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is not right, is not just, is not true to the best that is in you;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_102" id="page_102"></a>{102}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I know and esteem you, and feel that your nature is noble,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lifting mine up to a higher, a more ethereal level.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore I value your friendship, and feel it perhaps the more keenly<span class="linenum">50</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you say aught that implies I am only as one among many,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you make use of those common and complimentary phrases<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most men think so fine, in dealing and speaking with women,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But which women reject as insipid, if not as insulting.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_103" id="page_103"></a>{103}</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Mute and amazed was Alden; and listened and looked at Priscilla,<span class="linenum">55</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thinking he never had seen her more fair, more divine in her beauty.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He who but yesterday pleaded so glibly the cause of another,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood there embarrassed and silent, and seeking in vain for an answer.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So the maiden went on, and little divined or imagined<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What was at work in his heart, that made him so awkward and speechless.<span class="linenum">60</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Let us, then, be what we are, and speak what we think, and in all things<br /></span>

<span class="i0">It is no secret I tell you, nor am I ashamed to declare it:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">So I was hurt at your words, and a little affronted to hear you<span class="linenum">65</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Urge me to marry your friend, though he were the Captain Miles Standish.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I must tell you the truth: much more to me is your friendship<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than all the love he could give, were he twice the hero you think him.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then she extended her hand, and Alden, who eagerly grasped it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Felt all the wounds in his heart, that were aching and bleeding so sorely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_105" id="page_105"></a>{105}</span><span class="linenum">70</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Healed by the touch of that hand, and hesaid, with a voice full of feeling:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But, as they went through the fields in the blessing and smile of the sunshine,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As if the thread she was spinning were that of his life and his fortune,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After a pause in their talk, thus spake to the sound of the spindle.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Truly, Priscilla,” he said, “when I see you spinning and spinning,<span class="linenum">45</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Suddenly you are transformed, are visibly changed in a moment;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You are no longer Priscilla, but Bertha the Beautiful Spinner.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here the light foot on the treadle grew swifter and swifter; the spindle<br /></span>

<span class="i0">While the impetuous speaker, not heeding the mischief, continued:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“You are the beautiful Bertha, the spinner, the queen of Helvetia;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She whose story I read at a stall in the streets of Southampton,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, as she rode on her palfrey, o’er valley and meadow and mountain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_132" id="page_132"></a>{132}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ever was spinning her thread from a distaff fixed to her saddle.<span class="linenum">55</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">She was so thrifty and good, that her name passed into a proverb.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So shall it be with your own, when the spinning-wheel shall no longer<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Drew from the reel on the table a snowy skein of her spinning,<br /></span>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
